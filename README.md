# ILPD-Data-Mining
+ Implemented and investigated performance of classification algorithms such as decision tree, K-nearest neighbors, logistic regression and random forest to classify patients with liver problems in a clinical data set.
+ Experimented and identified best features for different algorithms.
+ Performed data normalization using different methods (Min-Max, z-score).
+ Performed N-fold cross-validation on the data set.
+ Compared precision, recall and F-score of the algorithms.

+ This data set contains 10 variables that are age, gender, total Bilirubin, direct Bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, A/G ratio, SGPT, SGOT and Alkphos.
